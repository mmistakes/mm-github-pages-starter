About upcoming release Rakugo and missing links.

## Missing Download Links

So as you can notice I removed links to project downloads and docs.
New version of Rakugo needs tests - it was totally rewritten.
You can stili download old version if you want [here](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Rakugo-archive/releases/tag/2.1.06).

## About the upcoming release Rakugo 3.0.0

Vaasref and I rewrite Rakugo now:
- We remove *Framework* part from the name, is now just *Rakugo*
- It uses less code
- More clean code structure
- Now we will use branches for game-kits, addons and demos instead of subgit modules
- User now only need to use `Dialogue` custom node and nothing more
- More godot way - using groups and graphical signals connections
- Use of `has_method()` for `show()` , `hide()` statements
- Now `Dialogue` uses thread
- Removed RakugoProjectSettings tab in favor of using standard Godot's ProjectSettings in better way
- Now you can combine `say()`, `ask()` and `menu()` statements instead of using just one of them at once
- No more need for `if next_state():`, now after statements block you can use `step()`
- No more need for using `jump()` to jump in the next dialog in the same scene

## What about Some X Node or some x feature that was included in previous versions of Rakugo
Some of them will comeback as part of some Rakugo game-kits or addons.

## Known Issues
Now for Rakugo works correct you must reopen project again after first open.

## Download and test

Now this current version of Rakugo is consider to be stable beta, but we need testers so if you want to help us
 you can download/fork project template and port of *The Question*.
