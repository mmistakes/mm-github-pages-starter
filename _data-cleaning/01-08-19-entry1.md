## Purpose: Check md5, create adapter file, and get summary data on sequences 

### Check md5 sum to make sure sequence data downloaded correctly
Below is a short script to check if two strings are the same. When executed, it will prompt the user for the first string, then the second string. 

```	
#!/bin/bash
 
read -p "Enter first string: " str1
read -p "Enter second string: " str2
 
if [ "$str1" == "$str2" ]; then
    echo "Strings are equal"
else
    echo "Strings are not equal"
fi
```
But also changing directory to where the MD5 file and data files are and typing "md5sum -c *.MD5.txt" is easier.

md5 check sums look good. No corruption of data downloaded to this computer. The data has also been downloaded to my laptop and the Onthank lab's workstation at Walla Walla University. It will be backed up on a 125 gb thumb drive and a 4 tb external hard drive. 

### Adapters and Index used for sequencing
``` 
5' Adapter
5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT-3' 
3' Adapter - the index is ATCACG 
5'-GATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCACATCACGATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG-3' 
```


### FastQC run to check sequence data
```
fastqc -o QC --noextract -t 5 -a adapters.txt P_cali_g_USD16092980L_HKG7CDSXX_L1_1.fq.gz P_cali_g_USD16092980L_HKG7CDSXX_L1_2.fq.gz 
```
