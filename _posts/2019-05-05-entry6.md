## Purpose:
Make solutions for electroelution, stain a plug, and begin electroelution 

### Staining a Plug

#### Materials and Reagents

|qty|unit|reagent|
|---|---|---|
| 1.5 | microliter| ethidium bromide|
| 2 | | plugs|
| 4 | ml| TE |

#### Protocol
1. add 1 or .5 microliters of 10mg/ml ethidium bromide to plug tubes
2. let sit for 30 mins
3. remove solution from plug tube and add 1 ml of TE, let sit for 30 mins
4. remove TE solution from tubes and add 1 ml of TE to tubes
5. Place tubes under UV to check for DNA presence in gel

#### Notes
I didn't mark which tube got which concentration, but I couldn't tell a difference between brightness


### TBE Solution

#### Materials and Reagents

|qty|unit|reagent|
|---|---|---|
|27.14|g|TRIS|
|13.752|g|Boric Acid|
|10|ml|EDTA (.5 M)|
| ~500|ml| DI water|

#### Protocol
1. add reagents to beaker
2. add stir bar and place on stir plate until dissolved
3. remove stir bar, bring solution to 500 ml
4. check pH

#### Notes
pH was 8.43, good enough. Autoclaved for 15 mins @ 121 Celsius


### Electroelution

#### Materials and Reagents

|qty|unit|reagent|
|---|---|---| 
| ~ 200| ml| TBE|
| 5 | cm| 1 3/5" dialysis tubing|
| 2 ||dialysis tube clamps|
|1|| standard gel electrophoresis chamber, wires, and power supply|

#### Protocol
1. soak dialysis tubing in water for 15 min
2. try to open dialysis tubing, then soak in TBE
3. clamp one end of dialysis tubing
4. remove fluids from plug tubes
5. leave tubes open and cut end off of tube
6. use pasteur pipette to push plug into dialysis tubing
7. add ~1 mL of TBE to dialysis tubing and clamp shut
8. place dialysis tubing in gel electrophoresis chamber such that the clamped ends are near the electrodes
9. add TBE until dialysis tubing is cover
10. set power supply at 100 V 

#### Notes
1. Not sure of the correct amount of TBE to add to dialysis tubing
