## Purpose
Stop electroelution and remove solution containing DNA from the dialysis tubing

### Removing DNA solution from dialysis tubing

#### Protocol
1. turn off machine and switch electrode wires on the electrophoresis chamber. 
2. turn machine on for 1 min and then turn off
3. unplug wires from electrophoresis machine and unscrew wires from electrophoresis chamber lid
4. unclamp on end of the dialysis tubing and pipette fluid in tubing into centrifuge tubes
5. place tubes in freezer or fridge

#### Notes
1. for actual HMW dna removal cut tips off of the pipette tips in order to make them wider and less like to sheer dna
2. tubes were placed in freezer, probably not the best for the dna
3. start time was 1620 previous day and end time was 1100 hrs the following day for a total electroelution time of 18 hrs and 40 mins
