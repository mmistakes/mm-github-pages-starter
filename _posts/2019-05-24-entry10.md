## Purpose:
Extract sperm from gonads, acquire sperm count, and embed sperm cells in low melting point agarose plugs

### Sperm Extraction

#### Protocol
Followed [sperm extraction protocol](https://www.protocols.io/view/sea-cucumber-sperm-extraction-from-gonads-5pbg5in) with no modifications

#### Notes
1. gonads were originally stored in a -20 C freezer, they were thawed for 15 minutes before use
2. used ~1.5 cubic centimeters of gonads
3. gonads were placed back in the -20 C freezer

### Preparation of sperm extract for embedding in low melting point agarose

#### Materials and Reagents

|qty|unit|reagent|
|---|---|---|
|8||centrifuge tubes|
|8| ml|ice cold PBS|
|1||centrifuge|
|1||micropipetter|

#### Protocol	
1. 1 mL sperm extract per a centrifuge tube was aliquoted
2. all 8 centrifuge tubes were centrifuged for 5 minutes @ 2,000 rpm
> protocol called for 1,000 rpm. oops
3. supernatent was discarded
4. 1 ml ice cold PBS was added to each tube 
5. centrifuge tubes were vortexed on the highest setting to resuspend cells
6. tubes were centrifuged again for 5 minutes @ 1,000 rpm
7. steps 2-6 were repeated
8. remove supernatent and resuspended after bringing the volume to 1 ml using pbs.

### Sperm/Cell counting

#### Materials and Reagents

|qty|unit|reagent|
|---|---|---|
|1|| compound microscope|
|1||hemocytometer|
|1||hemocytometer slide|
|1||counting clicker|

#### Protocol
1. glass slide was placed on the hemocytometer (HC)
2. 10 microliters of sperm solution added to hemocytometer using a micropipette with the solution injected at the edge of the glass slide 
3. cells counted
> way too concentrated, unable to count, so dilutions were made
4. 3 dilutions of .1 ml sperm solution and .9 ml pbs were made
5. See tables below for results

|color|Dimensions| 	Area |	Volume at 0.1 mm depth|
|---|---|---|---|
||1 x 1 mm |	1 mm2 	|	100 nL|
|red|0.25 x 0.25 mm| 	0.0625 mm2| 	6.25 nL|
|green|0.25 x 0.20 mm |	0.05 mm2 |	5 nL|

|blue|0.05 x 0.05 mm |	0.0025 mm2| 	0.25 nL| 

> All the cells in two different yellow squares were counted for each of the 3 dilution counts

|tube|conc|count 1| count 2|Cell Density (cells/mL)|

|#8|.1 mL SS + .9 mL PBS| 347 | 528|10,416,667 |
|#7| .1 ml SS + .9 mL PBS| 469| 455|11,000,000 |
|#6| .1 mL SS + .9 mL PBS| 678| 732|17,625,000 |

> cell density was calculated using the app on this [website](https://www.hemocytometer.org/hemocytometer-calculator/)

### Making low melting point agarose plugs

#### Materials and Reagents

|qty|unit|reagent|
|---|---|---|
|.0115|g|LMP agarose|
|10|ml| PBS|
|1||hot plate|
|1||micropipetter|
|10||centrifuge tubes|

#### Protocol
1. .0115 g LMP agarose and 10 ml PBS were added and swirled in a small beaker
2. beaker was placed on hot plate set to 200 C
3. boiled quickly, agarose dissolved and the solution was clear
4. removed and let agarose solution cool
5. samples were incubated in water bath @ 45 C for ~ 5 min 
6. 50 microliters agarose and 50 microliter sample per a centrifuge tube were added to 10 centrifuge tubes. Agarose was added first, then the sample was pipetted into the bottom of the tube and the pipette slowly raised such that the sample was evenly dispersed throughout the agarose. agarose/sample mix was cloudy afterwards
7. plugs were placed on ice

#### Results and Conclusion
Plugs were not solidified after ~15 minutes on ice. They were then placed in a -20 C freezer. Even after this the plugs did not solidify. My guess is that we boiled the agarose too long or the temp was too high. But not sure. Redoing the plugs

### Making low melting point agarose plugs: Attempt #2 

#### Materials and Reagents

|qty|unit|reagent|
|---|---|---|
|.0298|g|LMP agarose|
|10|ml| PBS|
|1||hot plate|
|1||micropipetter|
|10||centrifuge tubes|

#### Protocol
1. heated the mix of agarose/PBS on hotplate till boiling vigourously
2. added sample/agarose mix as describe in the previous attempt
3. plugs were placed in -20 C freezer

#### Results and Conclusion
plugs did not solidify. Very strange. The hotplate was set to a lower temp, but I did not record what that temp was. However, the agarose did boil over again. Need to read up on reasons why agarose may not solidify, even when higher concentration of agarose is used.
