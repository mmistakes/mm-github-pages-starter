### Cuke Check

It's looking completely healed except for the stitches. I am tempted to try cutting the stitches, but I am inclined to leave it be
and see what happens. 

While looking at the spikes on their body, I began wondering if it is possible to tell how healthy or well-fed a cuke is based
on how thick their spikes are. 

The small cuke died yesterday evening, or was essentially dead. During examination I found the tissue around the wound and muscle inside
the body cavity to be swollen and filmy, very similar to what I have seen in previous dead cukes.
