|qty|unit|reagent|
|---|---|---|
|150|microliter|1M tris-HCl|
|14.85|mL|H2O|

### Protocol
1. ~500 microliters each added to two phase lock tubes
2. shaker: 60 rpm/10 min

    > No emulsion observed. Increase speed to 150 rpm for 10 additional min

3. Cent. 5k rpm for 10 min

    > Phase lock gel did not separate phases. set rpm to 9k for another 10 min

    > 9k rpm did not work. transfered solution to 2 new phase lock gels 

4. Cent. 5k rpm for 10 min

    > gel moved, but didn't seal.

    > Made new light phase lock tubes by adding vacuum grease to new cent. tubes and centrifuged at unknown speeds for ~5 min.

    > Cent. @5k rpm for 10 mins, didn't work

    > cent. @10k rpm for 10 mins, almost worked

    > cent. @13k rpm for 5 mins

5. aqeuous phases transfered to two new phase lock gel tubes using cut off pipette tip and 250 microliters phenol and 250 microliters chloroform added to each tube.

6. shaker 150 rpm for 10 min, then gently mixed by inverting tubes
7. cent. 20 min @5k rpm
8. combined tubes into cent. tube, total ~.75 mL, then transfered to 15 ml falcon tube
9. added 5M NH3OAc at half volume ~.35 mL
10. added 3 volumves ice cold absolute ethanol. ~ 3 mL

    > ethanol was placed in -20 C freezer a few minutes earlier

    > solution turned opaque immediately. precipated DNA looked fragmented and small

    > the solution at the very bottom of the falcon tube was clear, leftover phenol or something else?

11. DNA fragments fished out using hooked pastuer pipette and added to cent. tube with 1 mL ice cold 70% absolutele ethanol
12. a 1000 microliter pipette with tip cut off used to pipette out 1 mL of falcon tube and transferred to cent. tube. 
13. cent. 10k rpm for 10 min
14. pipetted off supernatent and added 1 mL ice cold 70% absolute ethanol
15. cent 10 min @ 10k rpm
16. pipetted supernatent and air dried for ~15 min
17. Added 100 microliters EB solution to each tube

    > stored in 4 C fridge

    > did not let ethanol completely evaporate

### Notes
1. Started with lyzed cells from previous attempt
2. used prot k solution prepared last spring and has been froozen at -20 C and thawed several times

### Results and conclusion
1. DNA took a few minutes to precipatate out of solution
2. I stirred the solution with hooked pasteur pipette before dna precipatated. I wonder if that sheared the DNA
3. I used a cut off pipette tip to transfer aqeous solution when phase lock gels weren't working to separate the phenol from the aqueous. I wonder if that also sheared the DNA a bit
4. I checked the eluted DNA a day later and some of it had dissolved and the EB solution appeared gelatinous
