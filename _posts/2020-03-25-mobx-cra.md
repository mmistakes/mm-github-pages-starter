This story is as old as time; I started a project and it grew into a mess. At a certain level of complexity, it makes more sense to use a state management solution such as [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/) or [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) rather than continuing to [lift state](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html). 

When I first started learning MobX I had some issues integrating it into my application. I set up my project with Create-React-App (CRA) and all of the documentation I read said I needed to [rewire]([https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired)) or eject the application. That was something I didn't want to do. As it turns out, rewiring or ejecting the CRA project is only necessary when using decorators. That led me down another rabbit hole... how do I not use decorators?! 

I found some [MobX documentation](https://mobx.js.org/best/decorators.html) which helped me get everything set up properly. **If you just want example code, here is a [github repo](https://github.com/benelan/cra-mobx) using CRA and MobX. There is a branch for class components as well.** It is not recommended to use a state management solution for such a simple application, so think of it as a template or boilerplate project to build on.

## What are decorators?
[Decorators](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators) are a new, experimental feature for ES6 classes. They are easy to use and read, however they require additional setup as mentioned above. Decorators are only supported with Babel and Typescript so far. If you choose to use TypeScript in your CRA project, you need to enable the option ```"experimentalDecorators": true``` in your ```tsconfig.json``` file. Furthermore, decorators are only supported in ```create-react-app@^2.1.1```. If you decide to use decorators this is what your MobX store might look like.
```javascript
import { action, observable } from "mobx"

export class CounterStore {
    @observable counter = 0;

    @action increment() {
        this.counter++;
    }
    @action decrement() {
        this.counter--;
    }
    @action reset() {
        this.counter = 0;
    }
}
```
And here is a React component displaying the count.
```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { observer} from "mobx-react";
import storesContext from '../contexts/storesContext'

 @observer
 class ShowCount extends Component {
     static contextType = storesContext;
     render() {
         const store = this.context;
         return (
             <div>{store.counter}</div>
         );
     }
 }

export default ShowCount;
```

## Avoiding decorators
This is what your store would look like without decorators. That main difference is that you need to call ```decorate``` instead of the normal decorator syntax. 
```javascript
import { action, observable, decorate } from "mobx"

export class CounterStore {
    counter = 0;

    increment() {
        this.counter++;
    }
    decrement() {
        this.counter--;
    }
    reset() {
        this.counter = 0;
    }
}

decorate(CounterStore, {
    counter: observable,
    increment: action,
    decrement: action,
    reset: action
})
```

The changes to the React component's syntax aren't too drastic either since ```observer``` is both a function and a decorator in mobx-react.
```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { observer} from "mobx-react";
import storesContext from '../contexts/storesContext'

const ShowCount = (
    observer(
        class ShowCount extends Component {
            static contextType = storesContext;
            render() {
                const store = this.context;
                return (
                    <div>{store.counter}</div>
                );
            }
        }
    )
);

export default ShowCount;
```
Those are the two differences to remember. Lastly, as you may have noticed, the example code above uses the [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to pass the MobX store down through the components. If you are still using inject for this, you can read about why that is obsolete [here](https://mobx-react.js.org/recipes-inject).
