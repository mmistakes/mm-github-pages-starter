#### Why there is a blog

The [Bioinformatics & Data Science Cooperative](https://research.fhcrc.org/coop/en.html), otherwise known as The Coop, is a cooperative that includes all groups and individuals at [Fred Hutch](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) interested in bioinformatics and data science.

Started at Fred Hutch, The Coop aims to address duplication of effort, wasted resources including time and money, lack of shared knowledge and best practices, and lost collaboration opportunities as it relates to data science. One way the community is doing this is with the [Fred Hutch Biomedical Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/) which aims to create a curated collection of documentation regarding policies, resources and tools available to our researchers to support the generation, analysis and sharing of their research data.

The content in the [Biomedical Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/) is intended to serve as an ‘on ramp’ to get up to speed on current best practices, communicate common procedures, and provide links to on-campus and external data science resources both for [Data Generation](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/generation/gen_index/) and  [Scientific Computing](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/comp_index/). Yet the collaborative, online database, knowledge-sharing nature of the wiki is not always the best resource for communicating knowledge on a particular topic to the community and for that we've created [this blog](https://fredhutch.github.io/coop/)  

#### Who should read the blog

Current [Fred Hutch](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) based postdocs, staff scientists, and research specialists as well as anyone interested in data science, data analysis, software development, or reproducible research methods in bioinformatics would get value from reading this blog. Additionally, anyone within the community with a desire to foster the sharing of documentation about available resources, best practices, and community guidance or those interested in learning, exchanging knowledge, and supporting and improving collaboration and innovation across disparate groups would find value in this blog.

#### Who can write for this blog

We actively encourage the Fred Hutch researcher community itself to write for this blog. The blog is designed to augment the [Biomedical Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/) which aims to support ongoing biomedical research now and in the future. It does so by creating an evolving source of documentation that grows and changes along with the particular interests and research tools available to Fred Hutch researchers and unifies content that bridges the divide between how research processes are performed in general and how those processes are performed at Fred Hutch specifically. This blog then can help communicate, share, and teach the material covered in the Biomedical Data Science Wiki in a manner that allows the researcher to do so in a linear narrative fashion that is often preferred. If you want to contribute to the blog please contact coophelp@fredhutch.org.
