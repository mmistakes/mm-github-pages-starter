#### Overview of Community Groups

The [Bioinformatics & Data Science Cooperative](https://research.fhcrc.org/coop/en.html), otherwise known as The Coop, is a cooperative that includes all groups and individuals at [Fred Hutch](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) interested in bioinformatics and data science. To help stimulate that interest and encourage learning and growth the Coop has a [newsletter](https://research.fhcrc.org/coop/en/newsletter.html), [slack channels](_posts/_drafts/DRAFT_2019-11-07-post-Slack.md), and a [calendar](https://fredhutch.github.io/FHBig/calendar/) of events. The Coop has also established and actively supports and encourages [community groups](https://research.fhcrc.org/coop/en/community/hosted-groups.html). Community groups are loose associations of individuals in the community who come together regularly around a particular tool, language, skill etc. and meet either quarterly, monthly, or weekly depending on the groups needs. These meetings usually focus on best practices, new approaches, tools, information sharing, or demoing a new workflow or process that others in the community may find valuable.

#### What they are

Here are some of the current community groups that we have here at the Hutch but it's not exhaustive as you can always create a new one but following the [guidelines here](.../2010-01-07-post-overview_community_group#how-to-start-one). 

- **Coop community meetings**: The Coop hosts community meetings once a quarter to share information from the data science community at the Hutch. Join us to learn about projects and events happening in our community! _**When & where**: Quarterly, usually A1-303 but check calendars_

- **Data visualization group**: Develops visualizations from data released by TidyTuesday. All programming languages (and even non-coders!) are welcome. See the #data-viz channel on The Coop Communities Slack for more information.

- **Nextflow group**: Discusses issues related to the use of Nextflow (and other workflow managers like Cromwell) at Fred Hutch. The group welcomes Nextflow users of all levels of expertise as well as those just learning about the tool. See the #nextflow channel on The Coop Communities Slack for more information.

- **Python coding group**: Discusses methods of programming in Python and troubleshoots code of participants. Python coders of all levels of expertise are welcome. See the #python-user-comm channel on The Coop Communities Slack for more information.

- **R coding group**: Discusses R packages, R code and troubleshoots code of participants. R coders of all levels of expertise are welcome. See the #r-user-comm channel on The Coop Communities Slack for more information.

- **Software design group**: Discusses issues related to software engineering and interface design and invites speakers on specific topics and participants to share their coding projects. This group is not focused on a specific programming language, but rather on issues common across software projects. See the #software-engineers channel on The Coop Communities Slack for more information.

#### How to start one

The Coop is happy to support formation of new community groups related to data science activities. We ask that you answer a few questions to guide your planning process:

* What are the goals of your group?
* Who is interested in participating
* Who will lead/facilitate the group?
* How often do you want to meet? Some groups meet weekly, every other week, or on the first/second/etc day of the month.
It may help to look at some of the information about existing groups to help get an idea of what has been working for our community so far. You can also post in the Coop Community Slack to gauge interest in the community. Once you are committed to the meeting details, contact one of the Coop team members with the following information:

* Title (e.g., "Python coding group")
* Description (e.g., "Any Python users (beginner to advanced) are welcome to attend this session and to talk about programming and data analysis in Python. Bring your lunch, your code questions, and your thoughts! Contact this person for more information.")
* Open or closed? We prefer community groups to be open to everyone. If you request a group to be closed, we'll add "[closed]" to the title.
* Who is the point of contact? We'll need someone to help answer questions about scheduling, etc.
*Time and date of the first meeting, and the continued schedule (so we can put a repeat on calendars)

We'll use this information to:

* post to the Google and Outlook calendars (we usually don't add community groups to CenterNet)
*announce in our monthly newsletter and on Slack
* list on our webpage and the training page on the Fred Hutch Biomedical Data Science Wiki.
