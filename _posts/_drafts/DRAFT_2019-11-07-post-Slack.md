#### Slack is a communication tool

At the Coop, or the Hutch's [Bioinformatics & Data Science Cooperative](https://research.fhcrc.org/coop/en.html), Slack is used to create and support a community of researchers, scientists, post-docs and all groups and individuals within the community interested in bioinformatics and data science. It’s a great place to get support for a particular tool, ask a question, or get guidance from others within the community like yourself. [Slack](https://slack.com) is also used by many more teams and departments here and abroad to communicate. If you already have Slack installed or know how to do so go ahead and continue on else if you are _**brand new to Slack**_ heading to the _Getting Started_ on the company’s page may benefit you https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-getting-started-for-new-members, then come back : )

#### Slack Installed

Once you have installed and launched Slack it’s time to **join the community** by [click here](https://fhbig.slack.com/) and joining the _fhbig.slack.com_ workspace. Anyone who has `@fredhutch.org`, `@sagebase.org`, `@sharp.org` and `@uw.edu` email addresses can join without invitation and the list can be expanded upon request. Once in the workspace you can access online channels, discussions, and communities here at the Hutch. Slack facilitates communication via community channels, which can be public or private, and direct messages.

_Channels_, which most are open, help you organize conversations around a topic or project within the workspace. When you make a channel, then everyone can see what is going on in that channel. This means it’s a good idea to create channels for different projects, topics, or a conversation between certain team members. You can also create private channels if you want to have a private discussion with just a few team members. Additionally, you can direct message a member which works like email reaching a member or multiple members quickly and directly.

#### How do you join a channel? 

Click "Channel" on the sidebar to search for existing channels. Then select the channel of interest you want to join. Here are some established channels you may want to join. These channels are design to help create and support the bioinformatic community here at the Hutch.

- *#data-viz* - Slack channel where you can converse with others across the organization about data visualization
- *#general* - Slack channel used to make announcements, display the weekly calendar, and ask general questions. It’s a great place to have your voice reach the most members
- *#python-user-comm* - Slack channel focused on python users where you can converse with other python users across the organization about approaches, tools, packages, or problems
- *#question-and-answer* - This is the place to ask questions related to scientific computing, bioinformatics, statistics, data sciences, programming or anything technical/academic. And please help us and share your knowledge here as well
- *#r-user-comm* - Slack channel focused on R users where you can converse with other R users across the organization about approaches, tools, packages, or problems
- *#software-engineers* - A channel for software development engineers and others creating user-facing software applications and tools to discuss challenges and get support
- *#nextflow* - User community support for using Nextflow at the Fred Hutch

Once joined and viewing a channel make sure to check out the channel’s _details_, _highlights_ and any _pinned items_ which you can see by clicking and viewing channel details as they contain valuable information which may be of help to you. 

#### Communication tips

Here are some ideas to keep supportive communication flowing

- A member says something in a channel that you want to converse or add to but _what do you do_? **You start a thread.** _Threads_ allow you to reply directly to a message, preserve context and encourage conversation without distracting the larger channel's conversational flow. To start a thread, hover over the message in the channel you want to converse about and click the "Start a thread" icon.
- You can use the at sign “@” combined with certain keywords like `@everyone` or `@channel` to alter the way members are notified about the message in which you embed them in. **BUT** with great power comes great responsibility and _there is an etiquette_ to using these `@terms` and they are listed below.
- do not `@` unless you really mean it and it would be of value to the group
- `@channel` - alerts anyone who has joined the channel whether they are online or not
- `@here` - only alerts people who are both in the channel and currently using Slack (ex. time sensitive stuff use this one)
- `@all` - alerts everyone in the group
- `@everyone` - is only to be used in a team’s _#general_ channel
- You can also [change your notifications levels](https://slack.com/help/articles/201355156-guide-to-desktop-notifications) as well
- Use threads when appropriate. When responding to an old message, respond in a or to the thread so that it is easier to follow the conversation and doesn’t disrupt other conversations that may be happening in the larger channel
- Tag someone if you are speaking to them using `@` then type in their name
- Format your code properly. When sharing code, use single backticks (`) for short code snippets, and triple backticks (```) for multi-line code snippets
- Post in the appropriate channel based on subject matter, tool, or topic
- Do not double post. Only ask a question once, in the relevant channel but feel free to cross post to other relevant channels by sharing the link to the original post or question
- Who moderates the communities??? The communities moderate the communities.
