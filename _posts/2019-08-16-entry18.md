## Purpose:
Prepare solutions for DNA extraction and gel electrophoresis

### 10X TBE

|actual|calc|unit|reagent|
|---|---|---|---|
|60.62|60.55|g|Tris base|
|30.99|30.9|g|Boric Acid|
|3.79|3.7|g|Na2EDTA|
|~500||mL|DI water|

1. Dissolve Tris, Boric acid, Na2EDTA in 400 mL DI water
2. adjust final volume to 500 mL
3. store at room temp

### .5X TBE

|actual|calc|unit|reagent|
|---|---|---|---|
|23.5|25|mL|10X TBE|
|~475|475|mL|DI water|

1. pipette 10X TBE into DI water

### 12.97M Ammonium Acetate

|25.5||g|Ammonium Acetate|
|25.5||mL|DI water|

1. Dissolve ammonium acetate in ~21 mL water
2. adjust volume to 25.5 mL

#### calculation

$$
\left( \frac{25.5g}{25.5mL} \right) \left( \frac{1 Mole}{77.083g} \right) \left( \frac{1000 mL}{1L} \right) =12.97M
$$

#### Note
Adding ammonium acetate to water greatly increases the volume. So much so that it exceeds the target volume. For example, I tried adding 38.55 gs to 40 mL of water with the goal of bringing the volume to 50 mL. This is as recommended by a calculator for calculating concentrations of solution (it is an app for andriod called Lab.Hacks). It overshoot the target volume. So I tried with 30 mL and the same thing happened. I am not 100% sure how this affects the molarity of the solution. So I checked wikipedia for what the saturation point is and created a "saturated" solution as per the calculations above.
