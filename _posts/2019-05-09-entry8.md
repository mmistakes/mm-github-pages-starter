## Purpose
Run quality analysis on electroeluted DNA from agarose DNA extraction plugs.

### Making Gel

#### Materials and Reagents

|qty|unit|reagent|
|---|---|---|
|.85|g|Agarose|
|80|mL|TBE .5x|
|.8| microliters| Ethidium Bromide|
|1||gel tray, well slot thingy, and electrophoresis chamber|
|2||gel tray wedges|

#### Protocol
1. mix TBE and Agarose in a flask
2. Microwave TBE/agarose solution with weight boat cover for ~ 1 min or until it is boiling 
3. add ethidium bromide
4. let cool for ~1 min, swirl
5. pour in gel tray and let sit for 1 hr

#### Notes
1. did not solution/bottle before microwaving so the concentration was not corrected and thus may differ a little calculated

### Runing Gel Electrohoresis

#### Materials and Reagents

|qty|unit|reagent|
|---|---|---|
|5|microliter|quickload 2-log DNA ladder (.1-10 kb)|
|30| microliter| sample 1 electroeluted DNA solution|
|50|microliter| sample 2 electroeluted DNA solution|
|1||gel electrophoresis power supply, wires, and chamber|

#### Protocol
1. placed gel in TBE in electrohoresis chamber and pushed out any air bubbles
2. added DNA ladder
3. added sample 1 to gel well #2 subsequent gel slots using 15, 10, and 5 microliters
4. added sample 2 to gel well #5 and subsequent gel slots using 20, 15, 10, and 5 microliters. 
5. attach wires to power supply and chamber lid and put lid on chamber
6. turned power supply on and set to ~102 volts, 35-37 mAmps, start time was 2051 hrs
7. end time was 2230 hrs for a total run time of 1 hr and 40 mins

#### Notes and Conclusion
1. used super thin pipette specific to running gels, however this may shear the dna and produce shorter fragments
2. all readily visible bands were above teh 10 kb mark
3. bands moved down the gel, no bands were present next to the wells at the end of the run which means there was no dna too large to 
move through the gel
4. the top quarter of the gel was light orange under UV light, not sure why.
5. there was no separation of the DNA bands in the gel. This suggests the dna was either too large to separate or the electroeluted dna 
was more or less all the same size
6. TBE used for electrophoresis was the same TBE used for electroelution. Probably won't do that again. Was just being lazy
7. There are very very faint bands lower on the gel around the 1 kb range, this may be shearing from the pipetting or something else

### Nanodrop electroeluted DNA quantity and quality

#### Materials and Reagents

|qty|unit|reagent|
|---|---|---|
|1||nanodrop machine|
|2||eletroeluted DNA samples|

#### Protocol
1. blanked machine twice using DI water
2. Added 1 microliter of sample 2 and recorded results
3. cleaned nanodrop sensor using ethanol and tissue wipe
4. added 1 microliter of sample 1 and recorded results
5. Centrifuged tubes @11000 rpm for 5 minutes
6. removed fluid from samles tubes down to .1 mL (accidently dropped one of the samples, forget which one)
7. added .15 mL of DI water to tube
8. repeated steps 1-4 and recorded results

#### Results
Sample 1:

|Sample|Centrifuged|A260|A260/A280|micrograms/microliter|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|2|No|.464|.86|23.2|
|2|Yes| .191|.84||
|1|No|.660|1.00|33.0|
|1|Yes|.296|.95|14.8|

#### Conclusion
1. centrifuging the DNA in water for the specified speed and time was not helpful or dropping one of the samples negated the result
2. There is contamination from something as showned by the low A260/A280 values
3. The quantity of DNA is also very low, probably need to use restriction enzymes to increase that yield
4. I need to remember to save the results to a file and look at the graphs to see what kind of contamination is present
