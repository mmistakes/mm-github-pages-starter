### Surgical removal of gonads

#### Materials and Reagents

|qty|unit|reagent|
|---|---|---|
|1||4-0 silk suture|
|1||surgical scissors|
|1||tapered micro spatula|
|2||falcon tube|
|1||ice and Ice bucket|
|1||forceps|
|1||dissection tray|

#### Protocol
1. anethestized sea cucumber was place on dissection tray
2. 1 inch incision was made on the dorsal side about midway on the body. 
3. gonads were collected and other organs pushed back into the body cavity
4. 4-0 silk suture was used to stitch the incision closed
5. sea cucumber was placed back into its container

#### Notes and Conclusion
The intestines and respiratory tree were expelled through the incision. Using the spatula, I pushed them back into the body cavity before suturing the incision closed. A short time after the sea cucumber was placed back into its container it evsicerated. I suspect the expulsion of the internal organs may have disrupted connective and vascular tissue between the respiratory tree and intestines leading to damage and the need to eviscerate. 

The incision for gonad removal should be made just posterior to the gonadopore near the sea cucumbers head in order to reduce the likelihood the respiratory tree or intestines are expelled.
