title: "Predicted Gene Interaction Tools"
---

After annotation of a genome is complete, the real fun begins. Tools and databases are available for predicting how genes will interact with each other and what that might mean. See below for some of those tools and databases. 

[STRING](https://string-db.org/cgi/input.pl?sessionId=Llq5aXPG8nBg&input_page_show_search=off)is a database of known and predicted protein-protein interactions. The interactions include direct (physical) and indirect (functional) associations; they stem from computational prediction, from knowledge transfer between organisms, and from interactions aggregated from other (primary) databases. 

While sea cucumbers are not present in the database, the purple sea urchin is and this may be a usual starting point for investigating the genome of the sea cucumber.
