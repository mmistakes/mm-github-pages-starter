![](/assets/images/IMG_9855.jpg){: .align-right width="300px" height="300px"}   I am a masters graduate student at Walla Walla University. While I am here my topic of study is the sea cucumber *Parastichopus californicus*. The goal of my thesis is to sequence, assembly, and annotate the genome of *Parastichopus californicus* in order to provide a critical tool for future research into their genetics. 

  At first, I wanted to investigate the expression of specific genes involved in their regenerative abilities. However, this enthusiasm was quickly stymied when I found little genetic information in the literature. That is when I decided it was time to remedy this problem and lay the foundation for future research. 

  To achieve the goal of a high quality draft genome, I will be employing two different sequencing technologies. The first is Illumina Hiseq X in which the DNA is first cut into short fragments before sequencing. The second is the long read sequencing platform called MinION manufactured by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. The combination of highly accurate short reads coupled with long reads is called hybdrid assembly and is a standard approach for generating high quality draft genomes. 

  When I am not reading papers, performing experiments, or doing computational analysis, I am out hiking, running, shredding tunes on my flute, reading science fiction, and otherwise musing about the future. If you want to talk science or are interested in my research feel free to contact me. I enjoy a lively discussion over a cup of coffee.
