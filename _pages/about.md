I’m a Staff Software Engineer at Quizlet.

I primarily focus on delivering awesome experiences with Android and Kotlin Multiplatform -- both for our users and my fellow engineers.

I've been involved with [Quizlet Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quizlet.quizletandroid) since I wrote its first lines of code in 2013. As the app has grown over the years (now with over 10 million installs), I've worked to scale our product, our team, and our engineering practices.

I went to MIT, where I organized HackMIT, did a lot of distributed systems research, and earned my:

* **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science**,
* and my **Master of Engineering** in **Computer Science and Engineering**, concentrating in **Computer Systems**
